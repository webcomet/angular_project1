            <h3>Ticket Types</h3> 
            <p><strong>Q: Whats the difference between FESTNATION and FESTV?</strong>
              A: FESTNATION is our pay-as-you-go all access global festival hub: where you can find out about hundred's of festivals globally, browse their programs, 
              see whats playing, engage, support and interact with a global film festival community that loves indie film. 
              FESTV is our subscription video on-demand service where you get to stream collections from Festivals for $3.99 a month.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Q: What the difference between a VIP and an ALL ACCESS ticket?</strong>
              A: VIP tickets are for festival invited attendees only. ALL ACCESS tickets are open to the general public.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Q: When I buy a VIP ticket I can only watch a movie once?</strong>
              A: It’s part of the many measures we go through to protect the filmmakers’ distribution rights. 
              We are offering the privilege to screen festival movies that are still seeking distribution and need to make sure those movies can attain that goal. 
              If you’d like to see the movie again hang around… I bet you will find it in our ALL ACCESS festival catalogs very soon.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Q: If I have a VIP ticket and I fall asleep during the movie can I watch it again?</strong>
              A: Yes. Once you push play, you have 48hrs to watch before you lose access.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Q: When I am on a filmmaker’s movie page there is a contact filmmaker button. What is this for?</strong>
              A: This is a funding platform designed for filmmakers’ to shop their next projects. 
              If you liked the current movie and are interested in helping this filmmaker make their next, then click on the link and we will put you two in touch.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Q: Why isn’t there a rating on the movie, like PG-13?</strong>

              we recommend you viewing it first or selecting the movie from a children focused festival.
