          <p><strong>FESTV/MEDIA</strong> is a film festival publisher serving as the global destination and pipeline for streaming entire catalogues of film festival content from years past through the current year in exclusive online viewing rooms. We cultivate subscriber bases and drive support and viewership to independent filmmakers and festivals alike. Launched in response to a growing need to bridge the gap between festivals, filmmakers and audiences, our aim is to provide our consumers with the best and most comprehensive film festival experience across digital platforms ensuring not one festival's feature or short is ever forgotten and is always viewable. 
          </p>
          <p><strong>FESTV</strong> is a new subscription on-demand service for fans of all things INDIE. We serve up raw, powerful, irreverent, and cutting edge stories told through eyes of todays most talented and dynamic filmmakers and content creators. You get festival darlings hand chosen by the fest staff, killer original programming, mayhem that somehow found its way onto our network, and everything in between. We hope you enjoy.... And yeah much of it's short form content because: 1. We know you're damn busy, and 2. We at FESTV feel it's about time shorts get the attention and recognition they deserve. </p>
          <p><strong>*</strong> Powered by indie filmmakers, festival staff, and industry veterans.</p>
